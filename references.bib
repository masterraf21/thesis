A survey was carried out to investigate the relationships among tasks, spreadsheet proficiency, usage, and satisfaction. The results suggested that the spreadsheet proficiency can have a greater impact on the tasks than the task can have on the spreadsheet proficiency. It was also found that spreadsheet users often do not use many of the commonly available spreadsheet features, and they do not appear inclined to use other software packages for their tasks, even if these packages might be more suitable. The proficiency of the spreadsheet users was not found to be related to the importance of the decisions being taken as a result of the spreadsheet analyses.},

Errors are thought to be prevalent in spreadsheets, and in some instances they have cost organizations millions of dollars. In a previous study of 50 operational spreadsheets we found errors in 0.8{\%} to 1.8{\%} of all formula cells, depending on how errors are defined. In the current study we estimate the quantitative impacts of errors in 25 operational spreadsheets from five different organizations. Within these 25 spreadsheets we identified 381 potential errors, of which 117 (31{\%}) were confirmed as errors by the developers of the spreadsheet. Among these confirmed errors, 47 (40{\%}) had no quantitative impact on the results. Among the remaining 70 confirmed errors, the largest error was {\$}100 million; however, 9 of the 25 spreadsheets tested had no errors at all. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This article reports on how to avoid errors in using commercial accounting spreadsheet application programs. Commercial spreadsheet application programs probably are accountants' most widely used computer tools. Research by a major accounting firm found that over 90{\%} of spreadsheets larger than 150 rows contained at least one significant formula mistake. And it takes just one small error--a single misplaced code--to produce wildly erroneous results. Such errors can be devastating because the data often are the foundation on which many organizations base their key decisions. It is possible to make spreadsheets not only virtually error-proof, but easier to use and more understandable. Unlike other information system programs, which typically are developed through extensive design and testing, spreadsheet files are mostly cobbled together on an as-needed basis by ordinary users. There are techniques that even ordinary spreadsheet users--those without special programming training--can apply to improve the quality' of spreadsheets and reduce--if not eliminate--the risk of errors.

For these practitioners, spreadsheets are necessary tools for traditional responsibilities such as planning, budgeting, forecasting as well as newer decision-making responsibilities. Responsibilities for managerial accounting practitioners have shifted from a transaction-based focus to an emphasis on decision support, planning, and control. Managerial accountants are expected to be key members of decision making and cross-functional teams outside the accounting area. Spreadsheets are major tools for meeting these new responsibilities. However, there is a significant gap in the literature with respect to what features of spreadsheets are most relevant for these new responsibilities. The purpose of this exploratory research is to provide evidence as to (a) what features of spreadsheets managerial accountants use, and (b) what features of spreadsheets new hires are expected to use.},

A large number of data integration tools exist, but they generally can only work on relational data. Existing systems for extracting relational data from spreadsheets are too labor intensive to support ad-hoc integration tasks, in which the correct extraction target is only learned during the course of user interaction. This paper introduces a system that automatically extracts relational data from spreadsheets, thereby enabling relational spreadsheet integration. The resulting integrated relational data can be queried directly or can be translated into RDF triples. When compared to standard techniques for spreadsheet data extraction on a set of 100 random Web spreadsheets, the system reduces the amount of human labor by 72{\%} to 92{\%}. In addition to the system design, we present the results of a general survey of more than 400,000 spreadsheets we downloaded from the Web, giving a novel view of how users organize their data in spreadsheets.},

Because spreadsheet data are widely available on a huge range of topics, a tool that allows easy spreadsheet integration would be hugely beneficial for a variety of users. We demonstrate that Senbazuru, a prototype spreadsheet database management system (SSDBMS), is able to extract relational information from spreadsheets. By doing so, it opens up opportunities for integration among spreadsheets and with other relational sources. Senbazuru allows users to search for relevant spreadsheets in a large corpus, probabilistically constructs a relational version of the data, and offers several relational operations over the resulting extracted data (including joins to other spreadsheet data). Our demonstration is available on two clients: a JavaScript-rich Web site and a touch interface on the iPad. During the demo, Senbazuru will allow VLDB participants to search spreadsheets, extract relational data from them, and apply relational operators such as select and join.},

  abstract = {Spreadsheets are among the most commonly used applications for data management and analysis. Perhaps they are even among the most widely used computer applications of all kinds. However, the spreadsheet paradigm of computation still lacks sufficient analysis. In this paper we demonstrate that a spreadsheet can play the role of a relational database engine, without any use of macros or built-in programming languages, merely by utilizing spreadsheet formulas. We achieve that by implementing all operators of relational algebra by means of spreadsheet functions. Given a definition of a database in SQL, it is therefore possible to construct a spreadsheet workbook with empty worksheets for data tables and worksheets filled with formulas for queries. From then on, when the user enters, alters or deletes data in the data worksheets, the formulas in query worksheets automatically compute the actual results of the queries. Thus, the spreadsheet serves as data storage and executes SQL queries, and therefore acts as a relational database engine. The paper is based on Microsoft Excel (TM), but our constructions work in other spreadsheet systems, too. We present a number of performance tests conducted in the beta version of Excel 2010. Their conclusion is that the performance is sufficient for a desktop database with a couple thousand rows.},

	isbn = {1492034029},
	publisher = {O'Reilly Media, Inc.},
	edition = {2nd},
	abstract = {Distributed systems have become more fine-grained in the past 10 years, shifting from
	code-heavy monolithic applications to smaller, self-contained microservices. But developing
	these systems brings its own set of headaches. With lots of examples and practical
	advice, this book takes a holistic view of the topics that system architects and administrators
	must consider when building, managing, and evolving microservice architectures. Microservice
	technologies are moving quickly. Author Sam Newman provides you with a firm grounding
	in the concepts while diving into current solutions for modeling, integrating, testing,
	deploying, and monitoring your own autonomous services. You'll follow a fictional
	company throughout the book to learn how building a microservice architecture affects
	a single domain.}

So, why does conventional wisdom insist that software engineers focus primarily on the design and development of large-scale computing systems? In this collection of essays and articles, key members of Googles Site Reliability Team explain how and why their commitment to the entire lifecycle has enabled the company to successfully build, deploy, monitor, and maintain some of the largest software systems in the world. Youll learn the principles and practices that enable Google engineers to make systems more scalable, reliable, and efficientlessons directly applicable to your organization. This book is divided into four sections: Introduction Learn what site reliability engineering is and why it differs from conventional IT industry practices Principles Examine the patterns, behaviors, and areas of concern that influence the work of a site reliability engineer (SRE) Practices Understand the theory and practice of an SREs day-to-day work: building and operating large distributed computing systems Management Explore Google's best practices for training, communication, and meetings that your organization can use}
